# 🚗 Ford Car Price Prediction

The Ford Car Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based application designed to estimate the market price of Ford vehicles using various technical and market-related features. In the automotive industry, accurately determining a vehicle's value is essential for both buyers and sellers, as it helps ensure fair pricing and informed decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about Ford vehicles including:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|------------|
| model | Car model |
| year | Manufacturing year |
| transmission | Transmission type |
| mileage | Distance traveled |
| fuelType | Fuel type |
| tax | Road tax |
| mpg | Miles per gallon |
| engineSize | Engine size |
| price | Target variable |

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The following visualizations were performed:

### Price Distribution
- Histogram with KDE plot

### Correlation Analysis
- Heatmap of numerical features

### Feature Relationships
- Year vs Price
- Mileage vs Price
- Engine Size vs Price
- Transmission vs Price
- Fuel Type vs Price
- MPG vs Price
- Tax vs Price

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

### Handling Categorical Features

Two encoding approaches were explored:

#### 1. One-Hot Encoding
```python
pd.get_dummies()
```

#### 2. Label Encoding
```python
LabelEncoder()
```

### Feature Scaling

StandardScaler was applied to numerical features:

```python
StandardScaler()
```

Features scaled:

- Year
- Mileage
- Tax
- MPG
- Engine Size

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

### Linear Regression

The dataset was split into:

- Training Set: 67%
- Testing Set: 33%

```python
LinearRegression()
```

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using:

- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

```python
r2_score()
mean_absolute_error()
mean_squared_error()
```
